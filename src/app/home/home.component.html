      Rick was born and raised in western North Dakota and has had a strong interest in handguns and military weapons
      from an early age. After high school, he served in the North Dakota National Guard as a Supply and Armor
      Specialist.
      <br><br>
      He then pursued a bachelorâ€™s degree in mining engineering. After graduating, Rick attended the police academy in
      Tucson, Arizona, where he served as a police officer for six
      years. Following his time in law enforcement, he shifted his focus back to mining, a career path that eventually
      led him back to North Dakota.
